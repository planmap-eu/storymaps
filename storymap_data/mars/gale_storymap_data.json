Did Life emerge at its surface, and if yes, for how long? Are Life-compliant conditions still present somewhere on Mars?

Today, our quest for the geological past of Mars continues, on a much finer scale.",

For example, in red, the cratered surface are the oldest terrains, having suffered heavy meteoritic bombardments. In kaki, the most recent terrains represent active dune fields, showing natural aeolian processes similar to those on Earth are happening at this very moment on Mars.",
