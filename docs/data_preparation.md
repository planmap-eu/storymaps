## Preparation of data (internal/external) for Planmap StoryMap App

Planmap app data are either locally served or fetched from remote server (tms, wms, etc.). The Planmap StoryMap App uses Leaflet and [OpepnPlanetaryMap](https://openplanetary.github.io/opm) basemaps as background, plus, as needed, local, regional or global tiles/map services.
