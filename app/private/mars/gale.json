Did Life emerge at its surface, and if yes, for how long? Are Life-compliant conditions still present somewhere on Mars? And of course, to prepare future manned exploration missions: where to land safely and make the most science? That’s where geological mapping comes into play",

First maps were drawn during the 19th century using direct observation with telescopes by famous astronomers Sciaparelli, Flammarion or Antoniadi. Today, our quest for the geological past of Mars continues, on a much finer scale.",

For example, in red, the cratered surface are the oldest terrains, having suffered heavy meteoritic bombardments. In khaki, the most recent terrains represent active dune fields, showing natural aeolian processes similar to those on Earth are happening at this very moment on Mars.",

Using its data, we can learn what kind of rocks are present in Gale, their exact chemical composition or their structures.
