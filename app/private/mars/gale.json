Did Life emerge at its surface, and if yes, for how long? Are Life-compliant conditions still present somewhere on Mars? And of course, to prepare future manned exploration missions: where to land safely and make the most science? That’s where geological mapping comes into play",

First maps were drawn during the 19th century using direct observation with telescopes by famous astronomers Sciaparelli, Flammarion or Antoniadi. Today, our quest for the geological past of Mars continues, on a much finer scale.",

For example, in red, the cratered surface are the oldest terrains, having suffered heavy meteoritic bombardments. In khaki, the most recent terrains represent active dune fields, showing natural aeolian processes similar to those on Earth are happening at this very moment on Mars.",

Through 2D and 3D analyses of Mastcam images, we reconstruct the vein network of a sample area and estimated the stress field. The region of interest has been recorded between sols 1536 and 1545 where light-toned veins crop out from rocky knobs belonging to the Murray Formation and can be followed on 4D surfaces. Assessment of the spatial distribution of light-toned veins shows that the basin infillings, after burial and consolidation, experienced a sub-vertical compression and lateral extension coupled with fluid overpressure and cracking. Overall, rock failure and light-toned veins formations could have been generated by an overload produced by infilling material within the basin.",
