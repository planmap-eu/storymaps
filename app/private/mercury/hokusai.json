      "text": "In this Storymap, you will be taken on a tour of the Hokusai quadrangle of Mercury. Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. It has been visited by two spacecraft, NASA’s Mariner 10 (1975–1976) and MESSENGER (2008–2015). Mariner 10 made three flybys of Mercury, but imaged only 9 of 15 of the planet’s mapping quadrangles. Hokusai was unimaged, and this meant geological maps of Mercury were not global. MESSENGER orbited Mercury and imaged it completely, which allowed this map of Hokusai, the first of its kind, to be made. This map will provide science context and targets for the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo mission to Mercury, which will arrive in December 2025.",

Impact craters on Mercury are named after practitioners of the arts: artists, writers, composers, performers, etc. Hokusai is the namesake for the whole quadrangle in which it is situated. Bright rays extend thousands of kilometres from Hokusai. Such rays fade in time, which means Hokusai probably formed within the last 350 million years. These rays extend over the north pole and nearly all the way to the opposite side of the planet.",

The craters here are much less crisp than Hokusai, which suggests they are older. Hokusai rays are on top of the smooth plains, which means the Hokusai impact came after the smooth plains formed. Some craters in this view are partially buried by smooth plains, which means they formed before the smooth plains. What are the smooth plains? We cannot be certain because no lander has sampled the composition of Mercury’s surface, but they are probably mostly lava flows.",

Although smooth compared with more cratered plains on Mercury, they still have some texture, including abundant wrinkle ridges that form a network across Borealis Planitia. Wrinkle ridges have formed because Mercury’s crust has been compressed, which caused it to fold and fracture in places, like the skin of a desiccating apple. Some wrinkle ridges join up in a circular shape, probably because they overlie an impact crater that has been buried completely by smooth plains. These are called ‘ghost craters’.",

This is the deepest crater on Mercury, and it has exhumed a great thickness of the planet’s crust. In enhanced colour, the dark blue material in Rachmaninoff is only found in other craters that have excavated deep into the crust, which suggests this material is from the lowermost crust. The smooth, orange material in central Rachmaninoff appears to have buried the rough, blue crater floor. This suggests the orange material is lava, similar to Borealis Planitia. The bright yellow patch in Rachmaninoff is ‘Suge Facula’ (‘facula’ means bright spot). It has a pitted texture, which suggests the lavas here were disrupted as they flowed over the dark blue crater floor materials.",

Explosive volcanic eruptions require a volatile gases in the ascending magma to form the bubbles that drive the explosion, just like shaking up a bottle of fizzy drink. Nathair Facula is a thin deposit and the underlying geology can be seen through it.
