Data to put here in this directory should be download from
PLANMAP cloud (cloud.planmap.eu) "stories > stories_v03"
(https://cloud.planmap.eu/index.php/s/GKaG29q2yPdM3E7).

Three directories are directly under 'stories/': mars, mercury, moon.
Those directories contain the raster/vector/model (media) data filling
each story.
(See ../tree.txt)

Notes:
* Inside 'mars/gale/maps' there are some '.zip' files, they must be unpacked.
