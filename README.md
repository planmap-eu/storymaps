# Planmap Stories

The Planmap Story-maps app, available at https://stories.planmap.eu, provides a standard platform for planetary data outreach.
Story-maps define a presentation of data or events in a light, interactive format, it resembles the telling of a story, with scientific data from Mars, Mercury, and the Moon.

In the first version of the app we have a fixed set of stories exploring three different presentation styles:
* a "_slide-show_", where the basemap plots as background for the presentation of media content (Mars/gale);
* a "_traverse-walk_", where the basemap displays a route where the story walks the user through (Mercury/hokusai);
* an "_interactive-board_", where the basemap presents interactive layers explaining the region (Moon/apollo).
